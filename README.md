## Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+
-   Access to an HPC cluster (via SSH)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    `ash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    `

2.  Install dependencies:
    `ash
    npm install
    `

## Development

To run the development server:

`ash
npm run dev
`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Production Build

### Standard Build
To build the application for production:

`ash
npm run build
npm start
`

### Standalone Build (Recommended for Deployment)
This project is configured to produce a standalone build, which creates a self-contained folder that does not require 
ode_modules.

1.  Build the project:
    `ash
    npm run build
    `

2.  The standalone build is located in .next/standalone.

3.  **Deployment Steps**:
    -   Copy the .next/standalone folder to your server.
    -   **Important**: Copy .next/static to .next/standalone/.next/static.
    -   **Important**: Copy public to .next/standalone/public.
    -   Run the server: 
ode server.js

### Windows Helper Script
For Windows users, a helper script 
un_standalone.bat is included. It automatically handles the copying of assets and starting the server.
